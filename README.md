# loudframe
This project is to integrate esp32 and audio playing, in a low cost package, for use in art projects.

# genesis

For 2019 burning man, I had created a modest soundfield for The Flaming Lotus Girl's serenity project. I based that on Raspberry PI but
had two main problems. Dealing with Alsa and USB, with a multi-USB system, was difficult. It was hard to label and keep track of the outputs.
Or even to get it working, originally, at all. Second problem was price. Each RPI had to be used for multiple outputs, and higher quality
USB to sound units were fairly expensive, although with some lead time and experimentation I could probably get that sorted. The good news
was RPI and ethernet.

Recently, I have been interested in a greatly simplified build: using esp32, proximity sensor, and potentially my own design of
speakers and drivers, I could get higher quality and more diversity of application.

Thus, LOUD FRAME.
